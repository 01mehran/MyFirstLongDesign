            WAYGOOD is a meeting place for Richmond locals (and everyone else).
            Weâ€™ve taken the best parts of a bottle shop and a neighbourhood
            eatery and mixed them together. Drop past for a drink, stay for a
            bite or grab a bottle on the fly.
          </p>

            Our only rule is: come as you are and enjoy as you please. We look
            forward to seeing you.
